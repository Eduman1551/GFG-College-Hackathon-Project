# 📚 Study Buddy  
**College GFG Hackathon Project**

## 🧠 About the Project
Study Buddy is a local-hosted web platform built during our **first college hackathon** to help students who struggle with managing notes, understanding large amounts of text, and organizing study resources.

The platform integrates an **AI-powered assistant** that can:
- Answer questions based on uploaded or provided content  
- Summarize text and resources  
- Generate **visual mind maps** to help students understand concepts better  

⚠️ **Note:**  
This was our **first hackathon project** and our **first attempt at solving a real-world problem**.  
You may notice:
- Some vague or imperfect AI answers  
- Minor bugs  
- A simple, not-so-polished UI  

Despite that, the core functionality works, and we gave our best effort to make the project usable within the limited hackathon timeframe.

The platform also includes a **Login & Signup system**, where user information is stored securely in a database.
